# Unstructured Finite Volume Solver

Unstructured Finite Volume Solver for Partial Differential Equations

## Principles/Goals

1. Truly Fortran B)
2. Object Oriented Design for separation of geometry, physics and solution
3. Coarrays for shared memory parallelism
4. *pure*, *elemental*, *do concurrent* for shared memory parallelism
